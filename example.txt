The Scary Night

One dark and stormy night, me and my friend goes to the abandoned house on the hill. We was so scared but we still went inside. The door creaked loud and we seen a shadow moving!

"My foot is shaking," I tells my friend but he don’t listen. He walk ahead and suddenly, a big black cat jumps out! We screamed so loud that our voice could of broke the windows.

Then we heared a noise from upstairs. It sound like someone was walking but there weren’t nobody there! My friend say, "We needs to leave now!" So we runned out the house fast as we can.

When we got home, we realized we forgot our flashlight in the house. But we ain’t never going back there again!
